Need to be able to:
-  See available bets
-  Place Bets
-  See Balance (should show outstanding bets)
-  Resolve Bets
-  Leaderboard
-  Bet History?
-  See Rules

Rules:
This is just for fun, if you make it not fun for anybody (or potentially even just yourself) you will not be allowed to play anymore.
I can change the rules at any time (this is just for fun anyways)
Rule changes can be retroactive
Bets Freeze 1 hr before the first match of the weekend
Bets resolve within 24 hours (hopefully) of last match of the weekend


tables used:
events
event_options
event_winners
option_lookup


probably need lockout_time for bets in a table
Account for bet = UserID_EventID_OptionID
